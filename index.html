      <p>
        Bodybuilders, Powerlifters, Olympic weightlfters, Casual gym goers. 
        <p>The list goes on, however, the pursuit remains much the same. The development and creation of muscle and contractile strength. Now to the majority of those not initiated in the culture and spirit of the iron game, it may appear trivially simple. 
      <p><li>Eat your protein</li> <li>Lift heavy stuff</li> <li>Make some gains</li> 
       <p>This could not be further from the truth and over the course of this document, you will develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the complexity of muscular development and hypertrophy. </p>

    <header><u><strong>The Basics</strong></u></header>
    <p>With a litany of information spread far and wide across the internet, the task of distilling the nonesense from the fact can appear daunting to even the most seasoned of gym goer. Luckily, there are some simple principles that can allow you an inkling into whether or not the info you recieve is truly quality.<p>When you break down the muscle building process to it's absolute basic components, you are left with 3 main objectives: <li>Provide enough stimulus to force <code>adaptation</code></li> <li>Consume enough calories and protein to repair the muscle trauma.</li><li>Recieve enough rest to recover from your training.</li><p> Now that we have the basics covered, let's get into some more advanced concepts.</p> </section>
  <section id="progressive_overload" href="#progressive_overload" class="main-section">
    <header><u><strong>Progressive Overload</strong></u></header>
    <p> The human body in an incredibly complex and adaptive system that does not like to remain in flux very long. Stimulus and strwess is not enoguh to keep the body changing for very long as the body will adapt.<p> In comes progressive overload. <p> Progressive overload is the principle that allows for continuous muscle adaptation by continous increasing new stress to the muscle(often in weight, reps or sets) over several macro cycles, forcing adaptations in the target muscles. However, with this stimulation and repair of muscle damage comes a certain amount of fatigue.

  <section id="fatigue" href="#fatigue" class="main-section">
    
    <header><u><strong>Fatigue</strong></u></header>
    <p>If it was possible, everyone would just keep lifting more and more weight all the time until we were all 500lbs of pure muscle. Unfortunately, that is not reality.<p> If we were to attempt to constantly add weight and reps and sets forever, constant <code>injuries</code> would arise, you would feel run down and frequently be getting sick. <p> This is called fatigue, and there are 2 main types that play into muscle hypertrophy: Systemic and Local. <p> Systemic fatigue relates to your nervous system and dictates how hard your muscles are able to contract, how much mind-muscle connection you are able to feel and often general feelings of tiredness.
    <p><code>Local fatigue</code> relates to muscle soreness, as well as joint stress and local msucle pain. This fatigue is often the first to arise as well as the easiest to disappate, making hypertrophy training a delicate balance between fatigue and stress, relaxing and stimulating.

  <section id="bringing_it_all_together" href="#bringing_it_all_together" class="main-section">
    <header><u><strong>Bringing it all together</strong></u> </header>
    <p> By this point, you will understand the basics of hypertrophy, progressive overload and fatigue, but how do they fit together? How do they relate? Here's how.<p>Balance is important and difficult, though luckily it is also simple. Muscles require <code>stimulus and stress</code> to be primed to grow and rest, recovery, protein and calories to actually facilitate that growth. The body is also incredibly adaptive and so requires a continuous introduction of new stressors to keep driving adaptation, which is why we implement the rule of <code>progressive overload</code>. Finally, we have to manage fatigue. To build muscle consistently and optimally, we must keep pushing new growth, getting adequate rest and fuel to keep that growth and finally allow our body the time is requires to dissapate that acuumulated fatigue. <p> Following these principles, you are well on your way to the muscular physique of your dreams.
